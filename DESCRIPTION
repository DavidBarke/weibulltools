Description: Contains methods for examining bench test or field data using the 
             well-known Weibull Analysis. It includes Monte Carlo simulation for 
             estimating the life span of products that have not failed, taking 
             account of registering and reporting delays as stated in [VDA 3.2 2016, p. 349–350]. 
             If the products looked upon are vehicles, the covered mileage can be estimated as well. 
             It also provides non-parametric estimators like Median Ranks, 
             Kaplan-Meier [Abernethy 2006, chapter 2], Johnson [Johnson 1974, p. 38], 
             and Nelson-Aalon for failure probability estimation within samples 
             that contain failures as well as censored data.   
             Methods for estimating the parameters of lifetime distributions, like 
             Maximum Likelihood and Median-Rank Regression 
             [Genschel and Meeker 2010, p. 1] as well as the computation of 
             confidence intervals of quantiles and probabilities using the delta 
             method related to Fisher's confidence intervals 
             [Meeker und Escobar 1998, p. 236–237] and the beta-binomial confidence 
             bounds are also included. 
             If desired, the data can automatically be divided into subgroups 
             using segmented regression. 
             Besides the calculation, methods for interactive visualization of 
             the edited data using *Plotly* are provided as well. These 
             visualizations include the layout of a probability plot for a 
             specified distribution, the graphical technique of probability plotting 
             and adding regression lines and confidence bounds to existing plots.
